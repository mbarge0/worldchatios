**When to use:** When starting a new project or revisiting the overall product vision.
**When not to use:** When implementation has already started — use “Architecture Planning” instead.

Let’s generate the PRD using the Product Loop Template.
Ask clarifying questions about the problem, target user, and success criteria before drafting.
Use the provided structure (Objective, Core Features, etc.).
Ask for confirmation first that all of the questions about the project have been asked and answered before actually writing the PRD
When you get confirmation to write the PRD, write the result to `/docs/foundation/[project-name]-prd.md`.

**Product Loop Template reference:** /prompts/system/00_a_product_loop.md
