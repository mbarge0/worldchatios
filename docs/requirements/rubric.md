| **11-12** | **Excellent** | Sub-**200ms** message delivery on good network. Messages appear **instantly** for all online users. Zero visible lag during rapid messaging (20+ messages). Typing indicators work smoothly. Presence updates (online/offline) sync immediately. |
| **9-10** | **Good** | Consistent delivery under **300ms**. Occasional minor delays with heavy load. Typing indicators mostly responsive. |
| **6-8** | **Satisfactory** | Messages deliver but noticeable delays (**300-500ms**). Some lag during rapid messaging. Typing indicators work but laggy. |
| **0-5** | **Poor** | Inconsistent delivery. Frequent delays over **500ms**. Broken under concurrent messaging. |

### Offline Support & Persistence (12 points)

| Score (Points) | Rating | Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **11-12** | **Excellent** | User goes offline $\rightarrow$ messages queue locally $\rightarrow$ send when reconnected. App force-quit $\rightarrow$ reopen $\rightarrow$ full chat history preserved. Messages sent while offline appear for other users once online. Network drop (30s+) $\rightarrow$ auto-reconnects with complete sync. Clear UI indicators for connection status and pending messages. **Sub-1 second sync time** after reconnection. |
| **9-10** | **Good** | Offline queuing works for most scenarios. Reconnection works but may lose last 1-2 messages. Connection status shown. Minor sync delays (**2-3 seconds**). |
| **6-8** | **Satisfactory** | Basic offline support but loses some messages. Reconnection requires manual refresh. Inconsistent persistence. Slow sync (**5+ seconds**). |
| **0-5** | **Poor** | Messages lost when offline. Reconnection fails frequently. App restart loses recent messages. No connection indicators. |
| **Testing Scenarios:** | | 1. Send 5 messages while offline $\rightarrow$ go online $\rightarrow$ all messages deliver. 2. Force quit app mid-conversation $\rightarrow$ reopen $\rightarrow$ chat history intact. 3. Network drop for 30 seconds $\rightarrow$ messages queue and sync on reconnect. 4. Receive messages while offline $\rightarrow$ see them immediately when online. |
