## Phase 01 — Reflect & Handoff (Supermodule A: Platform, Identity & Data Services)

Date: 2025-10-21
Duration: Short build cycle migrating entrypoint to UIKit and stabilizing auth routing

### Reflection (Reflection Loop)

#### Summary of what was built
- Migrated app entry from SwiftUI to UIKit lifecycle using `AppDelegate` + `SceneDelegate`.
- Configured Firebase in `AppDelegate` and validated startup logs.
- Implemented UIKit screens: `LoginViewController` (email/password) and `ConversationsViewController` (placeholder with Sign Out).
- Routed on launch in `SceneDelegate` based on `Auth.auth().currentUser`.
- Preserved existing `AuthService` (Firebase Auth) and integrated directly.

#### Challenges and resolutions
- UI unresponsiveness and crash on launch due to Firebase AppDelegate swizzling without an app delegate.
  - Resolution: added real `UIApplicationDelegate` and switched to UIKit lifecycle; crash eliminated.
- SwiftUI auth state/routing race between Firebase boot and listener attachment.
  - Resolution: avoided SwiftUI state coupling by handling routing in `SceneDelegate` with current-user check.

#### Key learnings and changes to assumptions
- Relying on SwiftUI-only lifecycle can conflict with Firebase Messaging/AppDelegate swizzling; UIKit delegate restores predictable hooks.
- Direct UIKit routing via `SceneDelegate` reduces state synchronization complexity for MVP.
- Keep Firebase configuration centralized (single call in `AppDelegate`) to avoid races.

#### What went well
- Minimal, focused migration; no changes to `AuthService` implementation.
- Clear console logging for each step improved validation speed.
- Linter clean; no additional dependencies required.

#### What could be improved
- Add basic input validation and error toasts on login.
- Establish a simple navigation coordinator for future flows (signup, forgot password).
- Introduce lightweight analytics and crash reporting hygiene once flows stabilize.

#### Next-step recommendations
- Build conversations list (Firestore listener) and sign-out flow confirmations.
- Implement signup + profile bootstrap in UIKit.
- Add theming and loading states; centralize alerts.

### Handoff (Context Summary)

#### Phase Summary
- Phase Name: A.3–A.5 UIKit Auth Shell (MVP Routing)
- Phase Outcome: Login works; transitions to Conversation screen; sign out returns to login.
- Stability Rating: High for current scope.

#### Core Deliverables
- App entry: `/WorldChat/WorldChat/App/AppDelegate.swift`, `/WorldChat/WorldChat/App/SceneDelegate.swift`
- Auth UI: `/WorldChat/WorldChat/Auth/LoginViewController.swift`
- Conversations placeholder: `/WorldChat/WorldChat/Conversations/ConversationsViewController.swift`
- Build report: `/docs/operations/phases/recent/phase-01-build.md`

#### Testing Status
- Manual validation on simulator: launch, login with valid creds, route to Conversations, sign out.
- No unit/UI tests added in this phase (deferred).
- Logs confirm Firebase config and routing paths.

#### Risks and Limitations
- No formal tests; regressions possible as scope grows.
- Conversations screen is placeholder; no data wiring yet.
- Messaging/notifications deferred; presence handled later.

#### Next Objectives
- B.2: Conversations list (listener) and empty state.
- A.6: Signup bootstrap (profile doc) via UIKit flow.
- X.1/X.2: Error handling standards and logging hygiene.

#### References
- Dev checklist: `/docs/foundation/dev_checklist.md`
- Recent build report: `/docs/operations/phases/recent/phase-01-build.md`
- Firebase config: `/WorldChat/WorldChat/App/AppDelegate.swift`
- Auth service: `/WorldChat/WorldChat/Services/AuthService.swift`

#### Summary Statement
We stabilized the MVP auth flow by migrating to UIKit and centralizing Firebase configuration. The app now reliably launches, logs in, and transitions to a conversation placeholder. Next we will implement the conversations list, polish login UX, and expand routing.
