## Reflection — Supermodule B: Messaging & Collaboration (MVP)

Date: 2025-10-22
Duration: Multiday build across Start → Plan/Design → Build cycles

### What we built
- Conversations List (Firestore listener ordered by `lastMessageAt` desc) with empty state and live presence/typing status.
- Chat View with message listener, dynamic cell sizing, optimistic send, delivery/read receipts, avatars (incoming), and presence header dot.
- Typing indicators via RTDB (`typingIndicators/{conversationId}/{uid}`) in chat and surfaced as “Typing…” in the list.
- Presence using Firestore `presence/{uid}` (online/lastSeen) and RTDB heartbeat; lifecycle hooks for online/offline.
- Inline translation render (client-side display for `translations.{lang}`) with pending fallback.
- Basic images (Storage upload) with conversation preview update.
- Offline queue/replay (SwiftData) with timer-based retry.
- Foreground push notifications (permissions, APNs token → FCM, routing via notification payload).
- Profiles: display name + avatar upload/edit screen; avatars shown in conversation list and chat.
- Theming: brand palette (Dark Blue, Gold, Light Blue), nav bars, bubbles, and button styles.

### Challenges and how we resolved them
- Firebase config timing: Ensured `FirebaseApp.configure()` runs first in `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` to avoid init races.
- UICollectionView cell sizing crash: Replaced automatic height assumptions with a safe `boundingRect` calculation and a minimum 44pt height.
- Presence model drift (status vs presence): Standardized on `presence/{uid}` with `{ online: Bool, lastSeen: ts }` and RTDB onDisconnect; listeners refreshed in `viewWillAppear` to stay current.
- Duplicate listeners: Moved presence/typing attach points to `viewWillAppear` and cleaned prior handles; centralized detach in `deinit`/`viewWillDisappear`.
- Back button/title UX: Passed conversation title into `ChatViewController` and normalized back button to "Back".
- Push wiring: Added Messaging delegate and token upload to Firestore; foreground banner display confirmed. Function trigger to send message notifications is staged for the backend.

### Key learnings
- Combining Firestore (documents) with RTDB (ephemeral typing/presence) gives the best latency + durability split for chat.
- UIKit lifecycle clarity (SceneDelegate and `viewWillAppear`) is critical for reliable real-time listeners and presence.
- Dynamic text sizing must be explicit for stability; optimistic UI should always target a bounded, safe layout.

### What went well
- End-to-end MVP slice landed (B.1–B.11): list, chat, presence/typing, inline translation display, images, offline queue, push foreground routing.
- Brand integration unified colors and components; navy/gold scheme reads clearly.
- Linter clean; listeners and lifecycles are explicit and easy to reason about.

### What could be improved
- Translation target language still hardcoded to `en` for render; use profile primary language.
- Image thumbnail rendering in chat is minimal; add caching and size-aware thumbnails.
- Background push routing and full notification flows still pending.
- Stress and multi-device timing validations should be automated.

### Next-step recommendations
- Complete device validations: B.R2 timing on two devices, B.R8 rapid-burst test (script available).
- Wire profile primary language into translation display logic and Function.
- Implement backend Cloud Function for message sends → FCM delivery; include conversationId in payload.
- Add lightweight image cache and avatar prefetch in the list.
- Expand tests (unit/integration) for message state transitions and presence debounce.

## Handoff — Context Summary

### Current state
- Branch: supermodule-1-platform (Phase B merged into iOS app target)
- iOS app builds and runs; Firebase initializes on launch. Conversations and chat operate in real time. Presence and typing update live. Foreground push notification banners enabled; tap routes to chat. Profiles can be edited and avatars displayed.

### Build status
- Linter: clean
- Manual tests: pass for core flows (login → list → chat send/receive, presence/typing, images, offline replay)
- Pending device validations: B.R2 latency, B.R8 stress

### Documentation
- Plan/Build/Reflect files: `docs/operations/phases/recent/phase-03-01-plan.md`, `phase-03-02-build.md`, this `phase-03-03-reflect.md`.
- Regression checklist: `docs/operations/regression/phase-03-regression-checklist.md`.
- Test guide & scripts: `docs/operations/tests/phase-03-device-tests.md`, `scripts/burst-messages.ts`.

### Environment & prerequisites
- Firebase services: Auth, Firestore, Storage, Realtime Database, Cloud Messaging; rules updated for users, presence, conversations/messages.
- App capabilities: Push notifications enabled; APNs/FCM configured.
- Required iOS: Xcode 15+, iOS 16+.

### Deployment readiness
- Foreground notifications: ready; background path pending Function and APNs setup.
- Minimal risk items: listener cleanup and presence writes validated; continue two-device checks before release.

### Handoff instructions
- Open `WorldChat.xcodeproj` and run on two simulators/devices. Sign in with two test accounts.
- Validate presence/typing (list and chat), send/receive latency, avatars, and offline queue.
- For burst test: set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` and run `./scripts/burst-messages.ts <conversationId> <senderId> 20`.
- Ensure `.plist` and Firebase project settings are present; update `users/{uid}.fcmToken` by reinstalling or re-registering for remote notifications if needed.

- Config: `GoogleService-Info.plist`
- Docs: PRD and checklist in `docs/foundation/`; operations under `docs/operations/`
- Scripts: `scripts/burst-messages.ts`
- Contacts: MessagingService, PresenceService, ProfileService entry points
