# ðŸ§­ Master Regression Manifest

## Overview
This document defines all regression testing expectations across the project lifecycle. It aligns with the numbered, dependencyâ€‘aware development checklist and uses Supermodule prefixes:
- A â€” Platform, Identity & Data Services (MVP)
- B â€” Messaging & Collaboration (MVP)
- C â€” AI Assistant & Smart Replies (Postâ€‘MVP)
- D â€” Speech & Learning Analytics (Postâ€‘MVP)

## Phase Summary Table 
Each phase is listed with its respective core features, regression scope, and dependencies at a high level.

| Phase | Core Features Introduced | Regression Scope | Dependencies |
|-------|---------------------------|------------------|---------------|
| Phase A â€” Platform, Identity & Data Services (MVP) | App shell (SwiftUI), Firebase config (Auth/Firestore/Storage/Functions/FCM), Auth (email/password), profiles (name/avatar/languages), base SwiftData cache | App builds/launches; Firebase init stable; login/signup/logout; profile read/write; auth state restore | Apple dev setup, Firebase project/configs, SwiftPM |
| Phase B â€” Messaging & Collaboration (MVP) | Conversations list (listener), 1:1 chat send/receive, delivery states, read receipts, presence (Firestore), typing (RTDB), inline translation (Function + cache), foreground notifications (FCM), basic images (Storage), offline queue & replay (SwiftData) | Phase A intact; message ordering under rapid sends; translations degrade gracefully; offline recovery w/out duplicates; notification tap routes to chat | Firestore, RTDB, Cloud Functions, FCM, Storage, server timestamps |
| Phase C â€” AI Assistant & Smart Replies (Postâ€‘MVP) | askAI() with RAG over recent messages; generateSmartReplies() (3 bilingual suggestions); caching & rate limiting; client UI (AI modal, pills) | Phases Aâ€“B intact; AI timeouts/nonâ€‘200s donâ€™t block chat; rate limits enforced | Cloud Functions, OpenAI API, Firestore context/cache |
| Phase D â€” Speech & Learning Analytics (Postâ€‘MVP) | AVSpeechSynthesizer playback with word highlighting & speed control; basic usage/latency analytics; experiment flags | Phases Aâ€“C intact; audio failures isolated; no chat performance regression | AVFoundation, analytics pipeline (Firebase Analytics) |

## Notes
- This manifest defines what must be verified, not what was verified.
- Regression outcomes are documented per-phase in corresponding debug files.
- Update this manifest only when the phase structure or dependencies change.
